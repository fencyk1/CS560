 * It takes these and creates an object with the errors added to the source code under the line they are associated with (ie where the error is found).

	 * This method creates an ArrayList of strings. Each index is associated with a line of output. That output will eventually be to a file in the second pass. It creates
	 * this Array by merging the source code with the errors found in the source code. This maintains the source code in full but just adds the associated errors.
	 * The method doesnt return a value. Instead it stores the ArrayList<String>  as a member variable.
